# EdgeLLM-Scheduler
This project is to build a simulation system that includes multiple edge nodes (comparable to nodes in a blockchain), and use lightweight large language models (such as DistilBERT or GPT2-small) to predict the status of each node, and intelligently schedule tasks to the nodes with the most suitable resources.

## To Start:
    Create a venv and active:
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
